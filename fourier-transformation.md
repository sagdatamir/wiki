# Fourier transformation

I read an article about Fourier transformations. This was amazing. I have never studied that in university.

Basically that means that we can represent anything with sin waves with different parameters. Assemble them into one and get the result. Music, pictures are stored this way. They take up a lot less space. It is sort of encoding and compression.
